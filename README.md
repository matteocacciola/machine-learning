# Machine Learning

This repository collects a number of Machine Learning structures and algorithms.

## Artificial Intelligence
The `ai` folder contains a number of AI structures, implemented in NodeJs:
- Artificial Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Fuzzy C-means
- SVM

Each file contains the implementation of each structure, together with a description of the algorithm and some examples
of usages.

## Evolutionary Computation
The `evolutionary-computation` folder contains a number of Evolutionary Computation algorithms implemented in C/C++. I
have implemented these codes during my years as Ph.D. and Post-Doc fellow at the [University "Mediterranea" of Reggio Calabria
(Italy)](http://www.unirc.it), at the [Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory of the Michigan State University](https://www.egr.msu.edu/ndel/)
and at the [Institute of Technical Physics and Materials Science of the Hungarian Academy of Science](https://www.mfa.kfki.hu/).

Usually, these algorithms are used in optimization problems. This repository contains implementations of the following
algorithms:
- Ant Colony Optimization
- Bee Colony Optimization
- Colonial Competitive Algorithm
- EarthWorm Algorithm
- FireFly Algorithm
- FireWorks Algorithm
- Genetic Algorithm
- Particle Swarm Optimization

Most of the implementation can be compiled on GPU-based architectures, so using parallelization in order to improve the
performances. README files are provided with suitable commands useful to compile the sources.

Sometimes, the code is completed by a suitable PDF, describing the scientific fundamentals of the specific algorithm.
